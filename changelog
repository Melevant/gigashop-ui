-Stuff About My Shop-
-Remade! And 10x Better-

              -Learn Stuff like What Time/Day I Update My Shop-
Okay, so look here are some things you might or might not want to know, so I mostly Update my shop over the weekend, and I mostly all the time send you the new updated version of my shop every Monday. Unless problems happen If you're lucky I will not be lazy for once and update it again on Wednesday. When I think the newest updated version of the Giga Shop is ready, I Put the scheduled time and set it to 8:05 AM, Which is when you go to first-period class.

-Learn Stuff about Getting a job at my shop, and getting paid-
So, so far in the Giga Shop, there are only 2 positions, the first one is where you inform people you know, that are not in the Shop email, So you just tell your friends about me, And the shop if you succeed Tell Me their email, so I can add them to the shop and you will be getting paid. Now, the second position is, you help me think of games to add to my shop. If you're not in my period, then either wait until you have a period with me or email me your ideas. If you're wondering about what you're getting paid, well you're getting paid games 1 free game per week, it just depends on how good you do. Finally, if you do you will get paid at the end of the week.

-Learn why Deleted Games Like Minecraft, and Geometry Dash From My Shop-
Okay so, when I got Geometry Dash, I didn't use google drive to get it, so the one I got wasn't a virus. So, when I added it a long time ago to my shop a bunch of people wanted it. Until I found out that people started to get it, but instead of the one I had, they had the one that had a virus in it from Google Drive, I ofc still mad that I had to take it out of my shop. After a while, I got different games and soon got Minecraft, people got Minecraft Education Edition. So, what I do is take them and remove them from my shop and replace them with other new games I add to my shop.
